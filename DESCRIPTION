Description: Simultaneously collects profiling data at both the
    R and C/C++ levels (using 'Rprof' and Google's 'libprofiler' from
    'gperftools') and collates the results to present a unified view of
    the collected data.  Supports writing these combined profiles to R's
    usual 'Rprof.out' format (for interoperability with existing tools) or
    interacting with the external 'pprof' program for its rich
    visualization tools.
