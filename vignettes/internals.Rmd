This vignette describes internals and design choices of the *jointprof* and associated packages. Users most likely will be interested in the ["Introduction" vignette](https://r-prof.github.io/jointprof/articles/guide.html).

## Work in progress

- Common data format
    - Rprof files: Lowest common denominator
    - Existing codes were too specific
    - versioning data format, based on pprof internals

- Capturing samples: Only gperftools offered support for Linux and OS X (at least), early efforts started there
    - Contrary to `Rprof()`, samples are aggregated during profiling
        - Solution: Extract relevant parts of code that captures stack traces, write binary profile format
    - Alternatives: instrumenting, callgrind, AMD, VerySleepy, ...
    - Current OS X problems

- Merging samples
    - Relying on entries named `.Call` and `Rf_eval`

- Challenges and next steps
